# Game of Life in ES6

To play, first download the repository,then, in your terminal, run this command: 

<code>npm install</code> 


After that, either use File Open (Ctrl+o or Cmd+o) and navigate to the directory in your browser, or start an http server by typing in, on the command line, any of these commands:

* `php -S localhost:3000`
* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`
* `npm run servephp`
* `npm run serve`

in which case you can go to localhost:3000 to play the game.

<b>Note</b>, in this version there are a few additions:
1. You can stop the game, freezing it at any point, to perhaps add or remove squares
2. You can save and load games (useful if you want to put in a Glider Gun for instance)

There is also one other change, this version uses webpack instead of gulp, for no reason other than I fancied trying it out.
